                    I thought the process of how factoryized this chicken was in such a formal environment until it came into our hands. Through this thought, I thought of many things that could have come from ‘wild' enough and wanted to say how many things in our daily lives are ‘manufactured’ and ‘formatted’. Perhaps many things could become more natural and beautiful when they had 'wildness'. The dried petals surrounding the chicken wing are not wild flowers either. They were a bunch of tulips bought from Lidl and it was already ‘labeled' like a pack of chicken wings I bought. Through this idea, I wanted to tell how easily something existing with ‘wildness’ becomes formalized and labeled these days.
